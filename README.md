# Lidar Based Obstacle detection Project 

<img src="media/ObstacleDetectionFPS.gif" width="700" height="400" />

### This is the first project of Sensor Fusion Nanodegree course from Udacity.
**Lidar** sensing gives us high resolution data by sending out thousands of laser signals. These lasers bounce off objects, returning to the sensor where we can then determine how far away objects are by timing how long it takes for the signal to return. Also we can tell a little bit about the object that was hit by measuring the intesity of the returned signal. Each laser ray is in the infrared spectrum, and is sent out at many different angles, usually in a 360 degree range. While lidar sensors gives us very high accurate models for the world around us in 3D, they are currently very expensive, upwards of $60,000 for a standard unit.

In this project I have extensively worked on PCL libraries in C++ and completed below tasks:

1. Filtering of lidar cloud data using cropbox and extraction methods
2. **RANSAC segmentation** to differentiate the obstacle and plane
3. **KD-Tree** implementation and insertion of cloud points
4. **Euclidean clustering** implementation for obstacle separation
5. Bounding boxes for each obstacle
