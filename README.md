### This is the first project of Sensor Fusion Nanodegree course from Udacity.

In this project I have extensively worked on PCL libraries in C++ and completed below tasks:

1. Filtering of lidar cloud data using cropbox and extraction methods
2. RANSAC segmentation to differentiate the obstacle and plane
3. KD-Tree implementation and insertion of cloud points
4. Euclidean clustering implementation for obstacle separation
5. Bounding boxes for each obstacle
